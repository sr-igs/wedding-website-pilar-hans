This is one of the most popular coasts of Spain, with many tourists from all across Europe coming here every year. This also means you should be able to find a lot of information. For us, the stand out is Javea/Xabia, with its beautiful landscape and mostly pebble beaches, it is a good place for a combination of amenities, stunning nature and all kinds of beaches.",

It should be more quiet and less touristy, mostly used by local people. For us, the standouts are Benicarlo and Pe√±iscola. While Benicarlo is a fairly average town, it has a Parador (national Spanish hotel) which is a guarantee of quality. From there you can visit the historic town of Pe√±iscola, with its castle and old town surrounded by the sea - this was one of the locations used for recording Game of Thrones.",
