        description:"The Alto Palancia region is where a lot of Ignacio’s family originally comes from, and we think it’s a beautiful region with stunning mediterranean nature and quaint villages. There are lots of nice walks around here (Catherine is an expert as she regularly runs long distance), with stand-out attractions such as the “Salto de la novia” waterfall or the “Via verde ojos negros”, a 160km long green way which used to have a railway connecting an iron mine with the blast furnaces in the coast of Valencia. You can get here by train, albeit there’s only a couple a day and are quite slow, or by car, with a nice highway connecting it with Valencia. If this sounds interesting, please let us know and we’ll happily tell you more.",

You can visit its big Roman castle which lords over the city, as well as its Roman theatre, forum and museum. It even has a Michelin star restaurant: xxx. Easily accessible from Valencia by train or driving",

        description:"Segorbe is the town where a lot of Ignacio’s family comes from, and where Ignacio and Catherine spend a lot of time when in Spain. It is a historic town nested around nature - there is a Cathedral, an old wall, the remains of an aqueduct, parts of the old castle, an old town of narrow colourful streets… If you’d like to see it, let us know and we will give you more information (we might even be there some time around the wedding!). You can get here by a slow train (that runs 2-4 times a day) or by car (fully through motorways).",

Placed on a hill, completed surrounded by mediaeval walls and with an impressive castle looking over it, going to Morella feels like going back 1000 years in time. ",
